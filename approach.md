Seedwater Consulting is a facilitator of uncommon collaboration and thinking across historical barriers. When possible, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other agencies should be encouraged to collaborate, share best practices, and work together to achieve common goals. This is often the most efficient way to generate lasting change, both in institutional settings and in the lived experience of local communities on the ground.

Seedwater is different than other development consultancies that are unable to bridge disciplines and critically identify, analyze, and engineer the essential elements of multi-faceted projects. We strongly believe in targeted, context-specific, community-driven and led development, and the principles of rigorous design, implementation, monitoring, and adjustment of programs through cutting-edge qualitative and quantitative methods.

Seedwater Consulting works both in the United States and abroad, as we believe that there are communities around the world in need of support and resources to further their own visions for a sustainable, healthy, and just future.
