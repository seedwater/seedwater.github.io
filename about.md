> Let's change the world together. 

<br>
The Seedwater Collective is all about building justice and human understanding through hard work, human rights, community, and joy. We choose optimism and possibility as a response to injustice and suffering. Through our work, we aim to make the world a little happier, a little more equitable, and a little...kinder.

<br>
Seedwater has three arms, working together:

**The Seedwater Cafe**  
A community cafe and wine shop in Fort Collins, CO  
**Seedwater Solutions**  
A global NGO partnering for community empowerment  
**Seedwater Consulting**  
A boutique justice-focused development consulting group

##Our Approach

The founders of Seedwater come from a background international and agricultural development work, yet we also feel strong ties to the communities in the U.S. that we grew up in. We believe that the Seedwater Collective can bring together people from all around the world, united in large and small ways - through the joy of sharing a meal, of working alongside each other with a common vision, and through a shared desire for a more joyful and equitable world for all human beings.

Each of the three arms of the Seedwater Collective are run on the foundations of fairness, quality, and community. Seedwater wishes to build an environment that improves the ability of the people we meet to acheive their full potential, and to alleviate conflict by building understanding across cultural boundaries.
