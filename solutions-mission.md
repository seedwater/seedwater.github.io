> #*PLANTING SEEDS FOR A HEALTHY, SUSTAINABLE, AND JUST FUTURE - through collaboration”*  

<br>
##Mission:

Seedwater believes that the most successful forms of change are generated through avoiding past mistakes, but also through taking chances - and through planting and watering seeds. Seedwater values creativity, collaboration, and stepping outside of the box. 

It is possible to change the world through what are initially small seeds, which flower into well-established plants with deep roots.

Seedwater aims to generate a culture of compassion, understanding, empowermnet, and action – a culture that promotes self-sustainability and self-reliance, but also supports community building across historical divisions.

Seedwater's mission is to:
<ul>
<li>Empower people to actualize their full potential</li>
<li>Build collaboration across divides</li>
<li>Encourage community development through human rights first, not through top-down technocratic solutions</li>
<li>Apply resources in a sustainable and efficient manner</li>
</ul>


<br>
##Vision:

Our vision is of a sustainable, just, ethical future - where communities around the world are afforded the fundamental human rights of self-determination, access to key educational health services, and an ability to achieve a peaceful, productive, and joyful life of their own choosing. Seedwater envisions a world where human suffering declines at the same rate as environmental devastation, to be replaced by a more synchronous future. Seedwater works towards a future of higher cultural understanding, and a removal of the sociological and psychological barriers between "developing" and "developed" Societies.

##The Seedwater Method:

Seedwater believes that we’ve come too far to reinvent the wheel when it comes to community development.  Instead, non-profits, non-governmental organizations, and other agencies should collaborate, share best practices, and work together to achieve common goals.  Often, these entities are working in competition with one another—a practice that stunts development and is an inefficient allocation of resources.  We develop projects and generate change by working directly with communities and organizations on the ground, encouraging teamwork, and avoiding "competitive development."

Seedwater operates primarily through *seed granting* and *project partnership*, a method that allows us to strategically identify successful projects and local champions in a way that maximizes the flow of resources to program activities with minimal administrative overhead.  Why hire an expert to fly in from thousands of miles away when there is one just down the road working with another organization?  We value using local resources and employing people in-country, while creating efficient, collaborative solutions by partnering with institutions of wide-ranging and diverse expertise. 

Seedwater is different than traditional, large development projects that intend to reach hundreds of thousands of farmers at once. We strongly believe in targeted, context-specific, community-driven and led development, and we believe that communities grow and thrive through the support and generation of strong leaders and resilient equitable communities. Positive real-life changes stem from open, egalitarian relationships, which fuel innovation, growth, and energy for action. Seedwater works both in the United States and abroad, as we believe that there are communities *around the world* in need of support and resources to further their own visions for a sustainable, healthy, and just future.
