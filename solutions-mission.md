Collaboration 

The Seedwater Method:

Seedwater believes that we’ve come too far to reinvent the wheel when it comes to community development.  Instead, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and other agencies should collaborate, share best practices, and work together to achieve common goals.  Often, these entities are working in competition with one another—a practice that stunts development and is an inefficient allocation of resources.  We develop project and generate change by working directly with communities and organizations on the ground.  

Seedwater operates primarily through “Seed Granting” and project partnership, a method that allows us to strategically identify successful projects and individuals in a way that maximizes the flow of resources to program activities with minimal administrative overhead.  Why hire an expert to fly in from thousands of miles away when there is one just down the road working with another organization?  We value using local resources and employing people in-country, while creating efficient, collaborative solutions by partnering with institutions of wide-ranging and diverse expertise. 

Seedwater is different than traditional, large development projects that intend to reach hundreds of thousands of farmers at once. We strongly believe in targeted, context-specific, community-driven and led development, and we believe that communities grow and thrive through the support and generation of strong leaders and resilient equitable communities. Positive real-life changes stem from open, egalitarian relationships, which fuel innovation, growth, and energy for action. Seedwater works both in the United States and abroad, as we believe that there are communities around the world in need of support and resources to further their own visions for a sustainable, healthy, and just future.
