        <blockquote><p>Let's change the world together.</p></blockquote>

<p><br>
The Seedwater Project is all about building justice and human understanding through hard work, human rights, community, and joy. We choose optimism and possibility as a response to injustice and suffering. Through our work, we aim to make the world a little happier, a little more equitable, and a little...kinder.</p>

<p><br>
Seedwater has three arms, working together:</p>

<p><strong>The Seedwater Cafe</strong><br/>
A community cafe and wine shop in Fort Collins, CO<br/>
<strong>Seedwater Solutions</strong><br/>
A global NGO partnering for community empowerment<br/>
<strong>Seedwater Consulting</strong><br/>
A boutique justice-focused development consulting group<br/>
<br></p>

<h2>Our Approach</h2>

<p>The founders of Seedwater come from a background international and agricultural development work, yet we also feel strong ties to the communities in the U.S. that we grew up in. We believe that the Seedwater Project can bring together people from all around the world, united in large and small ways - through the joy of sharing a meal, of working alongside each other with a common vision, and through a shared desire for a more joyful and equitable world for all human beings.</p>

<p>Each of the three arms of the Seedwater Project are run on the foundations of fairness, quality, and community. Seedwater wishes to build an environment that improves the ability of the people we meet to acheive their full potential, and to alleviate conflict by building understanding across cultural boundaries.</p>

        <p><h2>Our Vision</h2></p>
        <p>We envision a world where people care about each other, where people around the world have their basic needs met, where people are valued. We envision a world where humans respect and value the natural world, and serve as proud stewards of the resources and wonder of our planet. We envision a world where human goodness prevails over pain, suffering, and selfishness - where the morals of the many overcome the corruption of the few.</p>
    <p>Seedwater Cafe can provide a space for people to learn, gather, have fun, and build the future the believe in. The cafe can also remind us that ethical and mindful eating is for everyone, not just the privileged few.</p>
    <p>Seedwater Solutions works towards a future of connection and partnership across national lines, empowering communities and individuals to lead us all into a more equitable and just future.</p>
    <p>Seedwater Consulting provides rigorous and context-aware expertise and services to development projects around the world, and provides support to the other arms of Seedwater Group.</p>
